# Program Name: Set Operations with Operator Overloading, Inheritance, Polymorphism

## Author: Abhishek Shrestha

## Overview:
This program implements a class hierarchy consisting of two classes: `mySet` and `OrderedSet`. The `mySet` class represents a mathematical set containing unique integers, while the `OrderedSet` class inherits from `mySet` and maintains its elements in sorted order. The program demonstrates the concepts of operator overloading, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Program Description:
The main function of the program performs the following actions:
1. Reads integers from input files and inserts them into `mySet` objects `S1` and `S2`.
2. Performs set operations such as Union, Intersection, and Difference on `S1` and `S2`.
3. Tests the equivalence of sets using the == operator.
4. Adds additional elements to `S1` and prints the updated set.
5. Deletes elements from `S1` and prints the updated set.
6. Repeats the above steps for `OrderedSet` objects `OS1` and `OS2`.
7. Prints appropriate messages to indicate successful operations and completion of the program.

## Instructions for Running the Program:
1. Compile the source code.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow on-screen prompts to input file names and perform set operations.
4. Review the output to observe the results of set operations and other actions.

## File Structure:
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main function and program logic.
- `mySet.h`: Header file for the `mySet` class.
- `mySet.cpp`: Implementation file for the `mySet` class.
- `OrderedSet.h`: Header file for the `OrderedSet` class.
- `OrderedSet.cpp`: Implementation file for the `OrderedSet` class.
- `input1.txt`, `input2.txt`: Sample input files containing integers to be inserted into sets.

## Dependencies:
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Notes:
- Ensure that input files are p
